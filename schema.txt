Schema for the KCA plug-in:

Plug-in global settings
-----------------------

Location: <plugin-config>/Parameters


Per-realm settings
------------------

(Note: the per-realm settings are chosen based on the identity realm.)

Location: <plugin-config>/Parameters/Realms/<realm>

KCAEnabled, int32, 1

    Boolean value.  If non-zero, obtains credentials for this realm.

NCerts, int32, 0

    Number of certificates that should be acquired for this identity.

Cert_<n>, string, ""

    Certificate number <n>, where <n> ranges from 0 to (NCerts - 1).
    Each string takes the form "realm=<realm>,hosts=<hosts>".

    - If the "realm=" setting is "[Identity]" then the identity realm
      will be used.

    - If "hosts=" setting is "[Automatic]", then the hosts will be
      determined automatically based on the specified realm.
      Otherwise, the list of hosts should be specified as a space
      separated list.

    If more than one string specifies a certificate for a realm, then
    only the first setting will be effective.

Legacy Per-realm settings
-------------------------

KCAHosts, string, ""

    String value.  Space separated list of KCA hosts to use.

KCARealm, string, ""

    String value.  Specifies the realm to use if KCAHostMethod is 2.

KCAHostMethod, int32, 0

    Method for determining KCA hosts. Currently, 0 means determine
    hosts automatically based on the identity realm (in which case
    'KCAHosts' value is ignored).  1 means use the 'KCAHosts' value,
    and enables specifying host list manually.  2 means determine
    hosts automatically based on the realm specified in the KCARealm
    value.

Identity settings
-----------------

Location: (global) <plugin-config>/Parameters
Location: (id specific) <identity-config>/KCACert

KCAEnabled, int32, 1

    Boolean value.  If non-zero, obtains credentials for this
    identity.

NCerts, int32, 0

    Number of certificates that should be acquired for this identity.

Cert_<n>, string, ""

    Certificate number <n>, where <n> ranges from 0 to (NCerts - 1).
    Each string takes the form "realm=<realm>,hosts=<hosts>".

    - If the "realm=" setting is "[Identity]" then the identity realm
      will be used.

    - If "hosts=" setting is "[Automatic]", then the hosts will be
      determined automatically based on the specified realm.
      Otherwise, the list of hosts should be specified as a space
      separated list.

    If more than one string specifies a certificate for a realm, then
    only the first setting will be effective.

Legacy Identity Settings
------------------------

KCAHosts, string, ""

    String value.  Space separated list of KCA hosts to use.

KCARealm, string, ""

    String value.  Specifies the realm to use if KCAHostMethod is 2.

KCAHostMethod, int32, 0

    Method for determining KCA hosts. Currently, 0 means determine
    hosts automatically based on the identity realm (in which case
    'KCAHosts' value is ignored).  1 means use the 'KCAHosts' value,
    and enables specifying host list manually. 2 means determine hosts
    automatically based on the realm specified in the KCARealm value.
